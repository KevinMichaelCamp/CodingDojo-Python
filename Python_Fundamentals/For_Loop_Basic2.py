# For Loop Basic 2

# 1. Biggie Size - Given an array, write a function that changes all positive numbers in the array to "big". Example: makeItBig([-1,3,5,-5]) returns that same array. changed to [-1,"big","big",-5].

# 2. Count Positives - Given an array of numbers, create a function to replace last value with the number of positive values. Example, countPositives([-1,1,1,1]) changes the array to [-1,1,1,3] and returns it. (Note that zero is not considered to be a positive number).

# 3. SumTotal - Create a function that takes an array as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in the array. For example sumTotal([1,2,3,4]) should return 10.

# 4. Average - Create a function that takes an array as an argument and returns the average of all values in the array. For example average([1,2,3,4]) should return 2.5.

# 5. Length - Create a function that takes an array as an argument and returns the length of the array. For example length([1,2,3,4]) should return 4.

# 6. Minimum - Create a function that takes an array as an argument and returns the minimum value in the array. If the passed array is empty, have the function return False. For example, minimum([1,2,3,4]) should return 1; minimum([-1,-2,-3]) should return -3.

# 7. Maximum - Create a function that takes an array as an argument and returns the maximum value in the array. If the passed array is empty, have the function return False. For example, maximum([1,2,3,4]) should return 4; maximum([-1,-2,-3]) should return -1.

# 8. UltimateAnalyze - Create a function that takes an array as an argument and returns a dictionary that has the sumTotal, average, minimum, maximum, and length of the aray.

# 9. ReverseList - Create a function that takes an array as an argument and return an array in a reversed order. Do this without creating an empty temporary array. For example reverse([1,2,3,4]) should return [4,3,2,1]. This challenge is known to appear during basic technical interviews.
